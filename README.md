# Arbit

arBit will be a mobile app built in React Native that will help a group of people on deciding what to eat, what to do or where to go out. Basically, when a group is created the people in the group will write down options of food, activities, restaurants, etc. Our algorithm will rank them based users' preference and produce the best choice for the group!
